# Matrix-Calculator
Matrix calculator made with C++

Made for the Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course

How to use:

Inputs must be squarematrixes (in the form of "[[1,2][x,y]]", [[1,x,2][3,4,y][a,b,c]]" etc.). Matrixes can include both numbers and letters.

The inputted matrix will be added to the stack. By inputting '+', '-' or '*' the corresponding calculation will be performed to the two topmost matrixes in the stack and the resulting matrix will be added to the stack. By inputting '=' the topmost matrix will be printed.

The user can input for example "x=1" to make the calculator associate a letter with the corresponding number.

By inputting "quit" the program ends
